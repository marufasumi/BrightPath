Write a function that takes in a number. It should return a “tower” of *. The tower will be an array of strings.

The number passed in tells you how many floors the tower should have.

The first floor should have 1 block, the 2nd should have 3 blocks, the 3rd should have 5 blocks, and so on.

Each block is represented by a *.

For example, a tower of 3 floors looks like this (note the spacing):

[
    '  *  ',
    ' *** ',
    '*****'
]
and a tower of 6 floors looks like this:

[
    '     *     ',
    '    ***    ',
    '   *****   ',
    '  *******  ',
    ' ********* ',
    '***********'
]

  function towerBuilder(nFloors) {
      var tower = [];
      for (var i = 0; i < nFloors; i++) {
        tower.push(" ".repeat(nFloors - i - 1)
                 + "*".repeat((i * 2)+ 1)
                 + " ".repeat(nFloors - i - 1));
      }
      return tower;
     }
